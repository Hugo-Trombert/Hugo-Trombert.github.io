    <br>
    <tt>Mechanical engineering Master's from EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland), class of 2025.</tt><br>
	  <br>
    <tt>Just finished my Master's Thesis in Caltech's Manthiram Lab, doing electrochemistry because I want to work on making gigascale cheap non-fossil hydrocarbons.
</tt><br>
	  <br>
<tt>>>> Long-time non-fossil hydrocarbons enthusiast: when I was 15, I grew microalgae in a photobioreactor and steam distillated it to extract the oil.</tt><br>
	  <br>
	  <tt>More recently I built a jet engine to improve my machining and welding skills. </tt><br>

<tt>----------------------------------</tt><br>
<tt><b>PAST WORK AND ENGINEERING EXPERIENCES: </b></tt><br>
<br>
<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>EPFL ROCKET TEAM</tt><br>
<tt>At EPFL Rocket Team, I designed the mechanical assembly for a modular cryogenic rocket engine electric pump. </tt><br>
<tt>I was supposed to design the geometry of the labyrinth seals, but I ended up designing the entire mechanical assembly of the pump in 4 months. Negotiated parts down saving more than 1500$.</tt><br>
<tt>Testing at our testing facility is expected later this year after the main competition.</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>SAILOWTECH</tt><br>
<tt>I co-founded and was Vice-President of Sailowtech, a student-group at EPFL that organizes and runs oceanographic expeditions and outreach events in schools on ocean conservation.</tt><br>
<tt>Our first expedition, focused on plankton and circling the North Atlantic Ocean for a year with a crew of 6, was a success, with research findings having already informed academic semester projects. I was a crew-member for the last 4 months, in Canada, Greenland and France.</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>EPFL CARBON TEAM</tt><br>
<tt>I designed and built a vacuum chamber from sheet metal with radiative heating elements for research on the performance of different adsorbants for Vacuum and Temperature Swing Adsorption (VTSA), a method for Direct Air Capture.</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>ALPHA IMPULSION</tt><br>
<tt>As an engineering intern for 2 months, working on the world's first autophage rocket (the tank is the solid fuel in the hybrid rocket engine, burning both radially and longitudinally like a candle), I designed dynamic tank parts which succeeded in the pressure tests, and I designed and implemented some of the electronics and interfaces for the electric motor control system.</tt><br>
<br>
	  
<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>OTHER:</tt><br>
<tt>- Part-time internship at CIM UPC doing mostly CAD,</tt><br>
<tt>- Summer and student jobs as a waiter, physics TA, in door-to-door sales, and in washing machine installation.</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>----------------------------------</tt><br>
<tt><b>ENGINEERING HARD SKILLS (besides the assumed MechE knowledge):</b></tt><br>
<pre></pre>
<tt>- Machining: 	self-taught, good enought to build a functional, low-thrust jet engine. I had no machining classes at EPFL so I bought used equipment and learned with friends and Youtube,</tt><br>
<tt>- Welding: 	    basic skills with MIG and stick on steel,</tt><br>
<tt>- PCB design: 	good on KiCAD for a MechE,</tt><br>
<tt>- Analytical chemistry lab experience.</tt></pre>
<br>

<tt>----------------------------------</tt><br>
<tt><b>HOBBIES:</b></tt><br>
<tt>In my spare time, when not working on personal projects (like those on my old <a href="https://www.instructables.com/member/Hugo%20Trombert/instructables/">Instructables</a>), I like to:</tt><br>
<tt>- fly airplanes (flew as towplane pilot at Yverdon Glider Club, flying the mighty Aerospool WT-9 for free), </tt><br>
<tt>- SCUBA dive, </tt><br>
<tt>- climb mountains (testament for enjoying Type >1 fun), </tt><br>
<tt>- travel to remote places (rode the Mauritania Iron Ore train and visited an indigenous community in the Costa Rica forest that had not been visited for 2 years),</tt><br>
<tt>- read books,</tt><br>
<tt>- repair my cars,</tt><br>
<tt>- learn languages (French: native, English: fluent, Italian: decent but I replaced most of it with Spanish, Chinese: beginner).</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>----------------------------------</tt><br>
<tt><b>THINGS I'M INTERESTED IN:</b></tt><br>
<tt>- decarbonizing heavy industry and transportation,</tt><br>
<tt>- exploring and settling space.</tt><br>
	  <br>
<tt>>>> Dreaming of GDP-GHG decoupling, and of industrializing Mars during the year and astro-mountaineering on the holidays.</tt><br>
