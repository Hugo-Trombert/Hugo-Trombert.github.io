    <br>
    <tt>Mechanical engineering Master's from EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland), class of 2025.</tt><br>
	  <br>
    <tt>Currently in Caltech as a visiting student for my Master's thesis in the Manthiram Lab, doing electrochemistry because I want to work on making gigascale cheap non-fossil hydrocarbons.
</tt><br>
	  <br>
<tt>>>> Long-time non-fossil hydrocarbons enthusiast: when I was 14, I grew microalgae in a photobioreactor and steam distillated it to extract the oil.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>----------------------------------</tt><br>
<tt><b>PAST WORK AND ENGINEERING EXPERIENCES: </b></tt><br>
<br>
<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>EPFL ROCKET TEAM</tt><br>
<tt>At EPFL Rocket Team, I designed the mechanical assembly for a modular cryogenic rocket engine electric pump. </tt><br>
<tt>I was supposed to design the geometry of the labyrinth seals, but I ended up designing the entire mechanical assembly of the pump in 4 months. </tt><br>
<tt>Testing at our testing facility is expected later this year after the main competition.</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>SAILOWTECH</tt><br>
<tt>I co-founded and was Vice-President of Sailowtech, a student-group at EPFL that organizes and runs oceanographic expeditions and outreach events in schools on ocean conservation.</tt><br>
<tt>For our first expedition focused on plankton, with a crew of 6, we circled the North Atlantic Ocean for a year from Europe to the Caribbeans, to Canada, Greenland and back to Europe. I was a crew-member for the last 4 months (the cold part).</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>EPFL CARBON TEAM</tt><br>
<tt>I designed and built a vacuum chamber with radiative heating elements for research on the performance of different adsorbants for Vacuum and Temperature Swing Adsorption (VTSA), a method for Direct Air Capture.</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>ALPHA IMPULSION</tt><br>
<tt>As an engineering intern, I designed, built and tested rocket parts -tanks, interfaces and avionics- for the world's first autophage rocket (the tank is the solid fuel in the hybrid rocket engine, burning both radially and longitudinally like a candle).</tt><br>
<br>

<tt style="color: red;"> <b> >>>>>> </b></tt><br>
<br>
	  
<tt>-----------------</tt><br>
<tt>OTHER:</tt><br>
<tt>- Part-time internship at CIM UPC doing mostly CAD,</tt><br>
<tt>- Summer and student jobs as a waiter, physics TA, in door-to-door sales, and in washing machine installation.</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>----------------------------------</tt><br>
<tt><b>ENGINEERING HARD SKILLS (besides the assumed MechE knowledge):</b></tt><br>
<pre></pre>
<tt>- Machining: 	limited skills, so I bought a mini-lathe on Craigslist a few months ago when I arrived in America to get better at it. (I'm in the process of turning it into a mini-mill by adding a z-axis!),</tt><br>
<tt>- Welding: 	    basic skills with MIG on steel,</tt><br>
<tt>- PCB design: 	good on KiCAD for a MechE.</tt><br></pre>
<br>


<tt>----------------------------------</tt><br>
<tt><b>HOBBIES:</b></tt><br>
<tt>In my spare time, when not working on personal projects (like those on my old <a href="https://www.instructables.com/member/Hugo%20Trombert/instructables/">Instructables</a>), I like to:</tt><br>
<tt>- fly airplanes (flew as towplane pilot at Yverdon Glider Club, flying the mighty Aerospool WT-9 for free), </tt><br>
<tt>- SCUBA dive, </tt><br>
<tt>- climb mountains (testament for enjoying Type >1 fun), </tt><br>
<tt>- travel to remote places (rode the Mauritania Iron Ore train and visited an indigenous community in the Costa Rica forest that had not been visited for 2 years),</tt><br>
<tt>- read books,</tt><br>
<tt>- learn languages (French: native, English: fluent, Italian: decent but I replaced most of it with Spanish, Chinese: beginner).</tt><br>
<br>

<tt>----------------------------------</tt><br>
<tt><b>THINGS I'M INTERESTED IN:</b></tt><br>
<tt>- decarbonizing heavy industry and sea and air transport,</tt><br>
<tt>- exploring and settling space.</tt><br>
	  <br>
<tt>>>> Dreaming of GDP-GHG decoupling, and of industrializing Mars during the year and astro-mountaineering on the holidays.</tt><br>
